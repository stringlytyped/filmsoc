overview: 'Two out-of-work actors -- the anxious, luckless Marwood and his acerbic,

  the unemployment office and the pub. When they take a holiday "by mistake" at the
  country house of Withnail''s flamboyantly gay uncle, Monty, they encounter the unpleasant
  side of the English countryside: tedium, terrifying locals and torrential rain.'
